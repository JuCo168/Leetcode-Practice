[2044. Count Number of Maximum Bitwise-OR Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-maximum-bitwise-or-subsets/)

There's a couple different solutions I've seen. First there's DP to find the max bitwise OR and in the process keep count of all possible subsets that when bitwise OR'd with our current value we get the max bitwise OR.
