[2294. Partition Array Such That Maximum Difference Is K](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-such-that-maximum-difference-is-k/)

Didn't complete this one. I initially thought we needed to split the list at certain points (i.e. maintain the sequence) but I then realized we can pull any values. I then thought to compare the min and max value of the list and if it was greater than `k`, remove max values until `max - min <= k` then recursively process the removed max values. This probably can work but I was running into syntax(?) issues with `max(nums)`. Either way the solution probably wouldn't have been great.

The correct solution makes a lot of sense. The minimum number of subsequences means we want as large of subsequences as possible so it makes sense to sort the list in increasing order. This way when we compare values, the first in the subsequence is always the min an the latest is always the max, and they are guaranteed to be as close in value as possible.

I need to review greedy algorithms and how to identify greedy algorithms. I guess **minimum** often suggests a DP or greedy problem.
