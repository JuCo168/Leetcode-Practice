[1722. Minimize Hamming Distance After Swap Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-hamming-distance-after-swap-operations/)

Lee has a [clever DFS solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-hamming-distance-after-swap-operations/discuss/1009867/Python-DFS-Solution). The observation is that if any swaps have overlapping elements (e.g. `[1, 3]`, `[3, 4]`), we can swap the elements freely (e.g. `[1, 3, 4]`)
