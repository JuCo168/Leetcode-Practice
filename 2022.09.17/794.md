[794. Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-tic-tac-toe-state/)

This was an easy problem but a pain to code. All possible win conditions must be checked. 

If `X` goes first, `count('X') == count('O') or count('X') == count('O') + 1`

If `X` wins, `count('X') == count('O') + 1`. If `O` wins, `count('X') == count('O')`.
