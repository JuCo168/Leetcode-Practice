[662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/)

One solution is to use BFS and give each node a value as if the tree were full. At the start of each level, the leftmost node's value is kept and compared was the rest of the nodes in the level are traversed. The distance is then the current node's number - leftmost node's number + 1.
