[1791. Find Center of Star Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/)

Really weird problem but very straightforward. If the only edges in a star graph are between the center and our nodes, then the center node must appear in all edges. 

Because we are given that there will be at least 3 nodes, we can simply check the common element of the first two nodes.
