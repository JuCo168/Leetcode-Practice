[1029. Two City Scheduling](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-city-scheduling/)

My initial solution of using a tree to calculate all posibilities is too slow. The solution is to first sum the cost of sending everyone to city `a`. Then calculate the price difference of sending everyone to city `b` instead of city `a`. This is done by `j - i for i, j in costs`.

Once this list is sorted, the smallest values are the costs for sending person `i` to city `b` instead of city `a`. We add the lower half to the cost of sending everyone to city `a` as our solution.
