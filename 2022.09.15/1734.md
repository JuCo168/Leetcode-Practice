[1734. Decode XORed Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-xored-permutation/)

This was conceptually difficult but easy to code. I knew that if `a ^ b = c`, `c ^ b = a` because `b ^ b = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a` for any `a`, `b`, `c`.

Therefore to get any value in the original permutation, we would need `perm[i] = encoded[i - 1] ^ perm[i - 1]` so we somehow need to get `perm[0]`. Reading through the hints tells us to XOR `1` through `n` and `encoded[1::2]`. How this works can be seen with a small example.

`encoded = [6, 5, 4, 6]`

`perm = [2, 4, 1, 5, 3]`

`x = 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5`

We know `encoded[1] = 4 ^ 1` and `encoded[3] = 3 ^ 3` so `perm[0] = 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ (4 ^ 1) ^ (5 ^ 3) = 2`. XORing `encoded[1]` guarantees we aren't removing `perm[0]` and XORing `encoded[3]` removes another 2 numbers without any overlap with `encoded[1]`.
