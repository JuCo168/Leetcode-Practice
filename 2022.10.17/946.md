[946. Validate Stack Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/)

Not the most elegant solution but it's easy to recreate the stack. If an element in popped matches the top element of the stack, pop it until no more elements can be popped. Once the last element is pushed, check if the remaining elements in `popped` can be popped.

This solution is `O(n)` time and space. An `O(1)` space solution exists by using `pushed` as our stack. We iterate through the pushed elements while maintaining a pointer to the top of our stack.
