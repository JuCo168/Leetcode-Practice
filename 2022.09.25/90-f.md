[90. Subsets II](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/)

The DFS and iterative solutions are correct versions of my original recursive idea. Given `[1, 2]`, the power set can be computed by computing power sets of smaller lists. Ex. `[[], [1]]` is the power set for `[1]`. If we want to add `[2]`, we can simply copy the list and add `[2]` to each element, giving us `[[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]`.
