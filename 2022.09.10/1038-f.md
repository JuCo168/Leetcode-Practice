[1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/)

I feel like I definitely could have solved this but just needed to think a little harder. The solution is to have a global counter and perform inorder traversal. Because a binary search tree has `left < node < right`, inorder traversal lets us add node values in order of largest to smallest.
