[1414. Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-number-of-fibonacci-numbers-whose-sum-is-k/)

Not a terribly bad problem but I didn't know exactly when to start. I thought it might be necessary to generate the Fibonnaci sequence up until `a + b > k` and Hint 1 confirmed that. 

After I generated the sequence, I realized that for `fib = [1, 1,..., b], b <= k` the minimum number of fibonnaci numbers always uses `b`. If `b == k`, `minFib(k) = 1`. Otherwise, `minFib(k) = 1 + minFib(k - b)`. This is actually a greedy algorithm because we do `k - b` every iteration until we get our solution.
