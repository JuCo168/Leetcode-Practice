[187. Repeated DNA Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/)

This was a surprising problem where my initial naive solution turned out to be the correct solution. To know if a 10-letter substring repeats, we need a way to keep track of all 10-letter substrings. The easiest way to do this is with a hashmap. It also has the benefit of `O(1)` insertion and lookup.
