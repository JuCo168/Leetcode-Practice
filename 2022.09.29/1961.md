[1961. Check If String Is a Prefix of Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-string-is-a-prefix-of-array/)

Pretty simple. Just check if each `word` in `words` is part of `s` in order. So you can use a pointer and traverse `s`. If you've reached the end of `s`, then each `word` required must have matched. Otherwise return `False`.
