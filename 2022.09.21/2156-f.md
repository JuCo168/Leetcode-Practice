[2156. Find Substring With Given Hash Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-substring-with-given-hash-value/)

Conceptually this problem isn't very difficult. Instead of computing the hash every iteration which is `O(n * k)`, save the previous hash and append the new value and remove the old. This is the concept behind a rolling hash.

The key to this is to hash values backwards. Because our hash is `(val(n[k - 2]) * p**0 + val(n[k - 1]) * p**1) % m`, updating our hash is fairly easy going backwards.
1. Remove the last term `val(n[k - 1]) * p**1` so we're left with `(val(n[k - 2]) * p**0) % m`
2. Multiply by `p`: `(val(n[k - 2]) * p**1) % m`
3. Add our new term `(val(n[k - 3]) * p**0 + val(n[k - 2]) * p**1) % m`

We iterate through the whole array, saving the index of the most recent equal hash and return the substring.
