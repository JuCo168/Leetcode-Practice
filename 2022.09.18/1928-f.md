[1928. Minimum Cost to Reach Destination in Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-reach-destination-in-time/)

With a shortest graph problem, the first thing that comes to mind is Dijkstra's Algorithm. But I wasn't sure how to consider both the price and the time. However, our problem is only concerned if `time < maxTime` and minimizing `cost`. Therefore, if it takes `tripTime > maxTime` to reach a city, there is no need to check its neighboring cities. 

With that out of the way, we can simply use Dijkstra's Algorithm and keep track of our trip time and the cost.
