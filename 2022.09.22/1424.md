[1424. Diagonal Traverse II](https://leetcode.com/problems/diagonal-traverse-ii/)

The key to this problem is the indicies on a diagonal all add up to the same value. So index `0` is the only value in its diagonal. `[0, 1]` and `[1, 0]` are on the same diagonal and add up to the same value.

The other key is if you read from the bottom row up and give each diagonal its own list, the order in which items are added to each diagonal list is the order in which they appear in the diagonal. For instance, elements appear in order of `[4, 0]`, `[3, 1]`, `[2, 2]`, `[1, 3]`, `[0, 4]`. Once the elements are added, combine each sublist into a single list and return.
