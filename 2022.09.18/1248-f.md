[1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/)

I didn't really know how to approach this one. I knew it was a sort of sliding window problem but didn't know what to do about the non-constant window size. 

Looking at the great [lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/discuss/419378/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Sliding-Window-O(1)-Space)'s solutions.

Both solutions work in similar ways. Find enough odd numbers to satisfy `k`. All indices before the first odd number are different subarrays. All indices past the last odd number are also new subarrays. If another odd number is reached, the process repeats.
