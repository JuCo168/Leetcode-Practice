[519. Random Flip Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-flip-matrix/)

I don't understand what this problem is asking or what the solutions are doing. [This solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-flip-matrix/discuss/154429/Python-solution-based-on-random-shuffle-with-explanation) uses `random.randint` to generate a random index then retreives that element in the dictionary?
