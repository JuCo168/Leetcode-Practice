[455. Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

I initially thought to just take the set intersection but this has an issue. If there are many children with the same greed factor and many cookies with the same size, they are only counted once because sets do not allow duplicate elements.

I then thought to count all values that are present in both lists. However this is also wrong as if there are multiple children with the same greed factor and one cookie of the right size, it will count for all children.

Instead sort the children and cookies. The child with the smallest greed factor takes the smallest cookie possible as any children with larger greed factors cannot take that cookie. Cookies too small will be skipped.
