[2226. Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-candies-allocated-to-k-children/)

This is a binary search problem but I had no idea how to approach it. [Lee's solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-candies-allocated-to-k-children/discuss/1908888/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Binary-Search-with-Explanation) implements binary search where the list of elements is the amount of candies each child can get. If we give each child `n` candies, the sum of `candies[i] // n` determines how many piles of `n` candies we can create. Binary search allows us to find `n` where all children can get `n` candies.
