[141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

Turns out there are two ways to solve this problem. The naive solution and `Floyd's Tortoise and the Hare` algorithm.

My naive solution changes the `next` of each node to be `head`. If any `node.next = head` then that node must have been seen. This solution is `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space. There's a more space-efficient version without the need for `cur` and `prev`. It does `head.val = None` every iteration and breaks if `head.val == None and head.next`. If there is no loop, `head.next is not None` is false.

Floyd's Tortoise and the Hare uses a `slow` and a `fast` pointer. `slow` increments by 1 and `fast` increments by 2. If there is a cycle, `fast` will eventually "lap" `slow` and the two will equal. This is `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space.
