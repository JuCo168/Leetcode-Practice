[1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree/)

This problem wasn't too hard to conceptualize and get a basic solution. I used DFS and maintained a dictionary of `seen values % 2`. If we sum the values and `sum(d.values()) > 1`, we know more than 1 value was seen only once. Therefore the ordering cannot be a pseudo-palindrome.

Looking at the solution the basic idea is the same but the implementations are a more clever. Like simply using a list and removing duplicate elements when inserting.
