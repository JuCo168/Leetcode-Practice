[1004. Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

I overthought this problem by trying to keep track of the number of `0`s in the sliding window. The key is the left pointer will continue to increment until the `0 == k` if `0 > k`. Therefore we only need to increment `l` if `k < 0` (if we subtract `1 - nums[r]` each iteration).
