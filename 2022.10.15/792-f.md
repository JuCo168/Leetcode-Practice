[792. Number of Matching Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-candies-allocated-to-k-children/)

I had the right idea to look at each element of `words` per character in `s`. This solution ends up being `O(s*len(words))` but not as quick as [Steve's solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-matching-subsequences/discuss/117634/Efficient-and-simple-go-through-words-in-parallel-with-explanation). He groups each `word` in `words` by their first character, and each iteration "checks off" the completed characters and redistributes the words by their second character.
