[2030. Smallest K-Length Subsequence With Occurrences of a Letter](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-k-length-subsequence-with-occurrences-of-a-letter/)

I understood that this was a greedy algorithm and we want to push out values in our stack to decrease the lexicographical order. What's difficult is under what conditions should values be popped and how many.

[This solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-k-length-subsequence-with-occurrences-of-a-letter/discuss/1500174/PythonJava-O(N)-greedy-solution-using-a-stack) solves our problem. It counts how many instances of `letter` exist in `s` so if we pop `letter` from the stack, we can ensure there are at least enough `letter` to fulfill `repetition`.

Each time we pop a `letter`, we are 1 more away from fulfilling `repetition`. Each time we push a `letter` we are 1 less away from fulfilling `repetition`.

The `elif k - len(sol) > repetition` is to ensure that there are enough spaces left in the string to fulfill `repetition` in the case that the next `k - len(sol)` characters are less than `letter`. 

Finally each instance of `letter` we see means there are less instances of `letter` remaining in the string.
