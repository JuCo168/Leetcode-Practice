[1906. Minimum Absolute Difference Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-queries/)

Couldn't figure this one out and I don't think I could do it in an interview. 

[This solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-queries/discuss/1284212/Python-Cumulative-sums-solution-%2B-2Liner-explained) uses a 2-d array to keep track of the count of the elements from `0` to `i` for each `i` in `nums`. 

To find what elements are in each `l, r` query, we find the difference between `dp[l]` and `dp[r + 1]`. Because `dp[l]` contains counts of elements up to `l`, subtracting it from `dp[r + 1]` gets us only the elements from `dp[l]` to `dp[r + 1]`. Getting the indicies of these values conveniently gets us the elements in increasing order so we can subtract `i - 1` from `i`.
