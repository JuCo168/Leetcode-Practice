[767. Reorganize String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/)

I initially had no idea how to approach this problem until reading Hint 1: `Alternate placing the most common letters.` 

Say we had an ordered list of the most common letters `[a, b, c]`. We'd want to place `aba...` until `count(b) < 0`. Then we move onto placing `c`. If `count(c) > count(a) - count(b)`, then our string will end with two consecutive `c`s. Otherwise if `count(c) == count(a) - count(b)` or `count(c) == count(a) - count(b) - 1` then our string will end in `ca` or `ac` respectively.

Essentialy if we can pair every character with a different character and are left with no more than 1 of a character, it is possible.

I couldn't figure out how to code this but there's a 4-line Python solution in the discussion. It uses a single line `a = sorted(sorted(s), key=s.count)` to sort the string in ascending order by how often the character appears. Then `h = len(a) // 2` and `a[1::2], a[::2] = a[:h], a[h:]`. This swaps the value of every other character starting at index 1(0) with a character in the first(second) half.

`cbbaaaa` Going character by character:

- `ac`
- `acab`
- `acabab` at this step all `a[::2]` have been filled.
- `acababa`
