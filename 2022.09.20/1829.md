[1829. Maximum XOR for Each Query](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-for-each-query/)

Pretty easy problem. To get the max value from `x ^ k`, `k` must be the inverse of `x`. Ex. `0011 ^ 1100 = 1111`. Conversely to find `k`, we can do `1111 ^ 0011 = 1100`. 

XORing each element of the array every iteration is not the most efficient as you end up XORing a lot of the same numbers. Ex. `0001 ^ 0010 ^ 0011` and `0001 ^ 0010 ^ 0011 ^ 0100` have significant overlap. Therefore instead of reducing the elements we XOR, we go backwards and XOR more elements. We start with `0001` and find its `k`. Then we XOR `x ^ 0010` and find its `k`.
