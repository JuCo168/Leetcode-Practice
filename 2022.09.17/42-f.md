[42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

I had the right idea of using two pointers but had no idea how to proceed after that. The best solution is to use 2 pointers and to keep track of the maximum left and right heights.

Essentially if `maxLeft` is greater than `left`, we can hold `maxLeft - left` water. If `maxLeft` is less than `left`, we have found a new `maxLeft` and can shift our left border to the right.
