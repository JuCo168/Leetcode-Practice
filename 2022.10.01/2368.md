[2368. Reachable Nodes With Restrictions](https://leetcode.com/problems/reachable-nodes-with-restrictions/)

This can be solved easily using DFS/BFS and sets for faster lookup. The only clever optimization I didn't think of was just using `restricted` to build `seen` since we cannot traverse seen or restricted nodes. Otherwise using a dictionary to keep track of undirected edges and a deque is simple.
