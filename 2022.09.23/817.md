[817. Linked List Components](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-components/)

I was really close to figuring this out but overcomplicated the problem a bit. I realized that to count consecutive groups, we only need to count when an element is present in both sets and the next element in the linked list is not in `nums` or is `None`.
