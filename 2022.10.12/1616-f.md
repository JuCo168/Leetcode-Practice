[1616. Split Two Strings to Make Palindrome](1616. Split Two Strings to Make Palindrome)

I'm not sure if I misread the problem but [Lee's solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-two-strings-to-make-palindrome/discuss/888967/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Greedy-Solution-O(1)-Space) makes absolutely no sense to me. Especially with input `a = "aejbaalflrmkswrydwdkdwdyrwskmrlfqizjezd"` and `b = "uvebspqckawkhbrtlqwblfwzfptanhiglaabjea"`, the resulting strings are `flrmkswrydwdkdwdyrwskmrlf`, `ckawkhbrtlqwblfwzfptanhig`, `aejbaalflrmkswrydwdkdwdyrwskmrlfqizjezd`, and `uvebspqckawkhbrtlqwblfwzfptanhiglaabjea`. The resulting strings clearly aren't the same length as `a` or `b`.
