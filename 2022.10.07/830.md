[830. Positions of Large Groups](https://leetcode.com/problems/positions-of-large-groups/)

To solve this I used two pointers for a sliding window. The end of a window is determined by when `s[l] != s[r]`. If the size of the window is ` >= 3`, then `l` and `r` are appended to the solution. Then the end needs to be checked.

There are more elegant solutions but this works well.
