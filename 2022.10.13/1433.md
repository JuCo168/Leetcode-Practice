[1433. Check If a String Can Break Another String](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-string-can-break-another-string/)

The intuition behind why sorting and comparing each element is: for string `a` to break string `b`, all `a[i] >= b[i]` for all `i`. We compare in increasing order because if `a[i] < b[i]`, there is no element in `a[i:]` that could break any element in `b[i:]`.

There is an `O(n)` solution that subtracts the count of each character in `a + b`. The idea is for every element in `a` there exists an element in `b` such that `a[i] >= b[i]` unless `x` is present more in `b` than in `a`. By iterating in alphabetical order, we check if there are sufficient values in `b` such that values in `a` can be broken by values in `b`.
