[1104. Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-in-zigzag-labelled-binary-tree/)

Really tricky problem but I'm glad I figured it out. Instead of going down the tree, find the parent of the current node. I did this by finding the level of the current node and the total number of nodes.

Given this information, we can find the largest number in the previous level. We then count up until we get our label. The parent node is then the largest in the previous - the number of "pairs" we iterate over until our matching node is reached.
