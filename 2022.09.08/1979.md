[1979. Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-greatest-common-divisor-of-array/)

This is an easy problem so it was easy to solve. The biggest optimization would be getting the GCD. I did the naive solution counting up from 1 which works but isn't the fastest. The easiest optimization would be to count down from the min value. 

The best optimization would be to use the Euclidian Algorithm for GCD. If we have `a`, `b` where `a < b` and divisor `d` where `a % d = 0` and `b % d = 0`, then `b - a % d = 0`. So our GCD problem can be simplified as `gcd(a, b - a)`. We can skip multiple iterations by doing `gcd(a, b - am)` where `m` is such `b = am + r`.
