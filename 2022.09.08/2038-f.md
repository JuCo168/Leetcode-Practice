[2038. Remove Colored Pieces if Both Neighbors are the Same Color](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-colored-pieces-if-both-neighbors-are-the-same-color/)

This problem is simple in concept and really easy to overthink. If colors contains `AAAA`, Alice could pick out a letter twice. My naive solution was to remove an `A` and keep checking but that's very slow. The correct solution is to count groups of 3 so `[AAA]A` and `A[AAA]`. You can picture this like always removing the first character and continually checking the first three characters. This also works because removing letters does not give the opponent a new opportunity.
