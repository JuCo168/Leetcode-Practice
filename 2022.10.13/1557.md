[1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-vertices-to-reach-all-nodes/)

This was surprisingly easy but maybe it's because I weirdly good at graph problems. If you reverse a DAG, the sinks are nodes that can be reached from the equivalent node. Therefore all sinks are required to reach all nodes in the graph.
