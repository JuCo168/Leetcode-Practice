[2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list/)

This is a really weird question. Each pair of nodes is `(i, -i)` therefore the most straightforward solution is to either use two pointers or iterate through half the array and use a negative index for each pair. 

This only works with a list so space is `O(n)` as opposed to `O(1)` solutions which reverse the second half of the linked list. However this solution needs 1.5 iterations through the linked list as opposed to 2.
