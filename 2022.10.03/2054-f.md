[2054. Two Best Non-Overlapping Events](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-best-non-overlapping-events/)

Saw this problem and thought it was a greedy problem, but didn't know how to solve it. [This solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-best-non-overlapping-events/discuss/1552570/Very-Simple-sort-%2B-greedy%3A-No-DP-no-Binary-Search-no-HeapPQBST) uses a greedy algorithm and doesn't make use of any DP, heap, binary search, etc.

It sorts events by their start and end time. It sorts events by their start and end time. If a start time is seen, we compare its value to the value of finished events + current event value compared to our previous answer. If an end time is seen, we compare its value to our current value of finished events. 

By only replacing the value of finished events instead of adding to it, we limit our solution to 2 events.
