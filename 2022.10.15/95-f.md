[95. Unique Binary Search Trees II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/)

After realizing that simply getting all permutations and inserting into the graph won't work, I thought a recursive solution would work. A helper function would be needed since you can't use the original function to recur on values higher than the root.

Marking as `f` because I looked at a solution for the implementation though I had the right idea.
