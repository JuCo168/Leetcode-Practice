[191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

There are a lot of different solutions to this that are all fairly simple.

Using division: `n % 2` gives the lowest bit-position, and `n // 2` shifts `n` to get the next bit position. 

Bit shifting: You can do `n & 1` to get the rightmost bit and add it to the count then bitshift right by 1.

Removing 1: From a discussion post. Perform `n &= n - 1` each iteration and increment count `while n:`. This removes the lowest `1` bit e.g. `0b0110 & 0b0101 = 0b0100`

Libraries: Use Python's built in libraries to convert to binary and count the number of `1`s.
