[747. Largest Number At Least Twice of Others](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number-at-least-twice-of-others/)

To solve this I just grabbed the max value and compared it against all other values in the list. However since this uses built-in functions it's not great as it can't easily be adapted to other languages that don't have the same built-ins.

The best solution without using built-ins is to get the highest and second highest value. If `second highest * 2 <= highest`, then the statement holds true for the rest of the array.
