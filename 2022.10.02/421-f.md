[421. Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-of-two-numbers-in-an-array/)

There's a [clever `O(n)` solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-of-two-numbers-in-an-array/discuss/849128/Python-O(32n)-solution-explained) that tries to build the solution not by XOR'ing every value but instead building the solution string and trying to recreate it using `nums`.
