[2221. Find Triangular Sum of an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-triangular-sum-of-an-array/)

My original solution used recursion but I hit the max recursion depth. So instead I used an iterative approach to overwrite values in nums. This approach isn't very fast but it's space efficient.

The optimal solution uses some clever math and is `O(n)`. It uses a reverse Pascal's traingle where the row in Pascal's Triangle corresponds to the coefficients for the top row. So for `len(nums) = 5`, the row is `[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]`
