[814. Binary Tree Pruning](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/)

I thought this problem was fairly straightforward. Binary tree problems can almost always be solved with recursion. The basic premise is to go up from the leaf nodes. If the value at the leaf is 0, remove it. Going up a level, if the value is 1 or the node has leaves, keep the node. 

This works because leaf nodes with value 0 are removed, so for a node in the level above to be kept it must either have value = 1 or contain a child node with value = 1.
