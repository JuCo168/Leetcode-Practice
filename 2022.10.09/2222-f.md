[2222. Number of Ways to Select Buildings](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-select-buildings/)

The intuition for this is a bit confusing. We only have 2 ways we can select buildings: `101` and `010`. Therefore if we see a `0`, we know we can add it to any `01` as part of our solution. We also know that we have at one more `10` strings.

We keep track of the number of `10` strings by counting the number of `1`s before our `0`.
