[1049. Last Stone Weight II](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/)

I thought this could be a DP problem because naively we'd try all combinations and optimize for the minimum.

Pretty sad I couldn't solve this `medium` problem and the solution I looked at called it "easy". Great confidence booster.

The reason why the rocks are split into two groups boils down to how you order the subtractions. Given rocks `[a, b, c, d]` one permutation is `(a - b) - (c - d) = a - b - c + d = (a + d) - (b + c)`.

We want the groups to be as close in value as possible, which means one group is to be as close to `total / 2` as possible. This is how it's like a knapsack problem. 

For our rows we want the number of stones. The KS equivalent is the number of items. For columns we want `sum / 2` which is our weight limit. Say we're given `stones = [2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1]` so `sum = 23` and `sum / 2 = 11`. If we do `2 + 7 = 9` which is close to our limit. So when we get to 4, our choices are to either add `4` (getting the weight when the limit was `4` less `+ 4`) or not adding `4` (get the current weight). 

The more efficient solution uses a set to keep all posibilities and adding to it if the sum does not exceed the weight limit.
