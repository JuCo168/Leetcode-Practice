[210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)

I didn't know how to approach the problem so I looked at hint 1 which suggested topological ordering. I completely forgot about topological sorting so I had to look it up, but it makes a lot of sense. 

Topological ordering lists all nodes in a graph where if there exists a vertex between `u, v`, `u` must appear in the ordering before `v`. So in our case, we want `v` to be a class and `u` to be its prerequisite.

GFG has a DFS topological sorting algorithm but does not fail if the graph contains a cycle. To check for cycles, a node needs three states: `unmarked`, `temporary`, and `marked`. When viewing a node, mark it `temporary` and recursively view outgoing edges. If an outgoing node is `unmarked`, traverse it. If an outgoing node is `marked`, skip it. If an outgoing node is `temporary`, it means from the `temporary` node, there exists a vertex reachable from `temporary` that has a vertex to temporary, thus a cycle. Only once you have viewed all outgoing nodes can you mark the node as `marked` and add the node to the stack.
