[1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-is-sorted-and-rotated/)

I'm sad I failed this easy problem. I got too stuck on just getting the min value and checking if all subsequent values are greater than the last. 

The better way to do this is to count the instances when `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`. If a list is sorted and shifted, this can happen only once. This is where the list should be starting.
