[20. Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

I'm definitely not proud of my solution. I had an idea to just add for every `(, {, [` and subtract for every `), }, ]` but that has issues. If you had `s = )(` then parentheses would sum to `0` and it looks fine. 

So I took a look at the hints and just did it with a stack. The code isn't clean at all but is roughly the same as the other Python solutions I looked at.
