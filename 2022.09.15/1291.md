[1291. Sequential Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/sequential-digits/)

I really overthought this problem. I was trying to create sequential numbers by appending digits then incrementing each position. But this problem is way easier done with a sliding window. 

Given our numbers `123456789`, we can move a window size `n = len(str(low))` and append our number to the solution array. We repeat this process for `n in range(len(str(low)), len(str(high)) + 1)`
