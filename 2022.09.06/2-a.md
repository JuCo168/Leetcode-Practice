[2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

This one I had the right idea for but couldn't execute. I was going for some recursive function because we had to progress l1 and l2 but there's no good way to carry a value doing that. 

The solution I looked at was pretty clever. Because the carry is always the sum, you can just do `//=` at the end of each iteration and add directly to it for the next. Another thing I didn't think of was using a dummy node to start so every iteration you can just set `cur.next = ListNode(sum)` and return `head.next`. Simple idea but I definitely didn't think of it.

Straightforward idea but I need to get better at the execution.
