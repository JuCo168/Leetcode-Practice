[236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

I didn't know how to do LCA but I had an ideas. I thought to use DFS but wasn't entirely sure how to progress if the two nodes haven't been found in the subtrees. In this case, you return `p` or `q` if `p` or `q` exist in that subtree. This way if the current node has `p` or `q` as one of its descendants, we maintain that `p` or `q` has been found.
