[844. Backspace String Compare](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/)

I wanted to challenge myself with an `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space solution and I almost got it. 

The simple `O(n)` space solution is to create a stack for both strings and `pop()` when a `#` is seen. Lastly compare the resulting strings.

The `O(1)` space solution requires 4 additional variables: 2 pointers for `s` and `t` and 2 counters for the number of `#`. The best approach is to count backwards and skip the next lowercase letter whenever we encounter a `#`.
