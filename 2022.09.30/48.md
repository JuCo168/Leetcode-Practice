[48. Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)

I don't remember how to transpose a matrix. But you'll notice that each row in the solution is a reversed column in the original matrix. As such we can either read columns in reverse order, or take the `n - i`th elemnt of each column for row `i`. The [very pythonic solution by Stefan](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/discuss/18884/Seven-Short-Solutions-(1-to-7-lines)) is to reverse the rows of the list then `zip` and insert back into the matrix. `zip` takes the `i`th element of each row and combines it into a tuple, which is then inserted in the `i`th row.
