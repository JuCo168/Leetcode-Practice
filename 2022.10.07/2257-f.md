[2257. Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-unguarded-cells-in-the-grid/)

I had the right idea with setting up the grid and iterating on the four cardinal directions. Only my method of traversing cardinal directions wasn't very efficient so I got TLE.

[This solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-unguarded-cells-in-the-grid/discuss/1994677/Python-Very-simple-Python-solution) uses a very similar concept but doesn't TLE.
