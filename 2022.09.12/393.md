[393. UTF-8 Validation](https://leetcode.com/problems/utf-8-validation/)

This problem was easy to conceptualize but difficult to code. For each number, if the bits don't line up with a UTF-8 character, `return False`. 

If the bits line up with a 2, 3, or 4 byte character, check the next 2, 3, or 4 ints. Then increment the pointer by 1, 2, or 3 to check the next character.
