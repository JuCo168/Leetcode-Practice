[779. K-th Symbol in Grammar](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-symbol-in-grammar/)

There are a few things to note about this problem:
- The length of each row is `2**(n - 1)`
- From row `n` to `n + 1`, the row is duplicated then all the bits are flipped. For example: `1: 0`, `2: 01`, `3: 0110`, ...


Because of this duplicate-flip rule, if `k <= 2**(n - 2)`, we can simply return `kthGrammar(n - 1, k)`. This is because the `kth` element is in the previous row. If `k > 2**(n - 2)`, we need to shift `k` down by `2**(n - 2)` and flip the result because the `kth` element is not in the previous row.
