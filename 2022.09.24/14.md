[14. Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)

My solution was to set `longest` as the length of the initial string. With every subsequent string, check if `strs[i - 1][:longest] == strs[i][:longest]`. If not, decrement longest until true.

This works because our longest substring can only decrease, so it makes sense to start long and decrement, as opposed to start short and increment.

A more efficient solution is to take a `max` and `min` strings and get their longest prefix.
