[11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

I had no idea where to start until I took a look at the hints. Hint 1 states simulating all possibilities is too slow at `O(n^2)` and Hint 2 states to use a left and right pointer and shift the lower of the two heights.

My solution is `O(n)`. The idea is to start as wide as possible and use `min(a, b) * (l - r)` to get the area. We want move the shorter of `a, b` because if we're moving a pointer towards the center, our width `w` is decreasing by 1. Our original area is `w * h1` so for `(w - 1) * h2 >= w * h1`, `h2 >= h1`
