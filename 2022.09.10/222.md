[222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

The easiest solution is to simply recur on the left and right nodes. But this is not the most efficient solution. 

Because the binary tree is complete, we know that all levels except the last are completely filled. That is, if the left depth is equal to the right depth, then the bottom row on the left is entirely filled and we only need to count the leaf nodes on the right. 

If the left and right height equal, we know the left subtree is completely full. Conveniently, the number of nodes in the left subtree is `2^height`. We can then recurse only on the right subtree to find the number of nodes in the right.

If the two do not equal, we know the right subtree is completely full and we can recurse on the left subtree to count the extra nodes on the left.
