[678. Valid Parenthesis String](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parenthesis-string/)

I couldn't quite figure this out. I used a stack to keep track of `(` and popped from the stack when there was a `)`. I also used a separate variable to keep track of `*`. 

[Lee's solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parenthesis-string/discuss/107570/JavaC%2B%2BPython-One-Pass-Count-the-Open-Parenthesis) keeps track of the maximum and minimum allowed `)`. If we see an `)`, we know we can have one less `)`. But if we see `(`, we know we can have one more `)`.

`*` allow for both one more `)` or one less `(`.
