[2209. Minimum White Tiles After Covering With Carpets](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-white-tiles-after-covering-with-carpets/)

I really need to practice DP more. I initiallly thought this was a Greedy problem until I read the hints. Even after reading the hints I wasn't too sure on how to approach the problem.

`DP[i][j]` is the number of remaining white tiles using `j` carpets such that the right side of the carpet ends at `i`. At `i`, we have two options: to skip the current tile or cover the current tile.

Skipping the current tile takes the previous tile (`DP[i - 1][j]`) and adds the current tile's value. Covering the current tile covers tiles `i - carpetLen` to `i`, so we get `DP[i - carpetLen][j - 1]`.

If I get a DP problem I'm screwed :grimacing:
