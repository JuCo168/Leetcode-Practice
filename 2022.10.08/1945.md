[1945. Sum of Digits of String After Convert](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digits-of-string-after-convert/)

Seems like all the solutions just repeat the transformation k times. I saw a [slight optimization](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digits-of-string-after-convert/discuss/1360766/Handle-k..z-first) which adds 2 digit numbers (ex. 15 -> 6) which does shorten the length of the string each iteration.
