[789. Escape The Ghosts](https://leetcode.com/problems/escape-the-ghosts/)

I looked at this problem yesterday but was too tired to solve it. However I do remember thinking I'd need the Manhattan distance to determine how far PAC-MAN and the ghosts would need to move. 

`abs(target[0]) + abs(target[1])` calculates the distance PAC-MAN needs to travel. The maximum distance a ghost would need to travel to catch PAC-MAN is `abs(target[0] - g[0]) + abs(target[1] - g[1])`, or the distance between each ghost and PAC-MAN.
