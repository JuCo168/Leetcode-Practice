[909. Snakes and Ladders](https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/)

Super annoying problem. I don't remember if I thought to do some kind of graph algorithm because of the different choices at each step, but the best solution is to use BFS. Put the next `i + 1` to `min(i + 6, n**2)` values in a queue and pop as you go.
