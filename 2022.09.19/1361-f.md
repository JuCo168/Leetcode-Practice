[1361. Validate Binary Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-common-words-with-one-occurrence/)

Revisiting this problem.

The key to this problem is the value of the node is the index of its children. So if we have `root = 2`, the left child is `leftChild[2]` and the right child is `rightChild[2]`.

Before that, we can first validate the tree with some properties:
- Each node should only appear once in the two children lists
- `set(range(n)) == set(root + leftChild + rightChild)` where `-1` is removed from `leftChild` and `rightChild`

Now we must traverse the graph to ensure all nodes can be reached. We traverse the tree knowing that a node's left child is `leftChild[node]` and right child is `rightChild[node]`. We can then keep a list of all the nodes visited and check if it equals `list(range(n))`
