[2201. Count Artifacts That Can Be Extracted](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-common-words-with-one-occurrence/)

I figured it out but my solution uses way too much space and time. I marked each dig site, and for each artifact summed the area the artifact covers. If it was equal to the calculated area, the entire artifact was excavated.

The better solution uses the same idea without marking the area. Instead you can look through each position the artifact would cover and check if it has been dug.
