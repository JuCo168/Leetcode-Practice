[94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

I had to remind myself what inorder traversal was. 
- Inorder is `left -> root -> right`
- Preorder is `root -> left -> right`
- Postorder is `left -> right -> root`

Once I got that it wasn't too difficult to write a recursive function. Looking at others' solutions I had the right idea but definitely not the most efficient looking code. Because of the `if not root:` base case, I could have omitted the `if root.left:` and `if root.right`.

I didn't attempt the iterative challenge but I looked at a couple solutions. Here a stack make a lot of sense because we want to store our traversed values and want to fetch the most recent value as it will be the furthest down the tree.
