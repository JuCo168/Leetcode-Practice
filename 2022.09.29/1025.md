[1025. Divisor Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/)

This one I actually solved but don't have a good way to prove other than: given an even number, player 1 continue to choose 1 such that player 2 must reduce `n` to an even number. This is because odd numbers are not divisible by even numbers and `odd - odd = even`.

Therefore to check if player 1 will win, we check the parity.
