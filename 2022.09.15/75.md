[75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

This problem is easy if you disregard runtime or space. You could simply sort which is `O(nlogn)`. You could get the frequency of each number and then replace each index in `nums` with the `0, 1, 2`. This is `O(n)` but requires `O(n)`(?) space to store frequencies and two passes on `nums`.

This is a [Dutch Flag Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem) proposed by the great Edsger Dijkstra. Essentially you use three pointers, `i, j, k`, to index where each color should belong. The algorithm checks the value pointed to by `j`. If `nums[j] == 0`, we switch `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` and increment both. If `nums[j] == 1`, we switch `nums[j]` and `nums[k]` and decrement k. 



- `i, j, k = 0, 0, 5`, `nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]`
- `i, j, k = 0, 0, 4`, `nums = [0,0,2,1,1,2]`
- `i, j, k = 1, 1, 4`, `nums = [0,0,2,1,1,2]`
- `i, j, k = 2, 2, 4`, `nums = [0,0,2,1,1,2]`
- `i, j, k = 2, 2, 3`, `nums = [0,0,1,1,2,2]`
- `i, j, k = 2, 3, 3`, `nums = [0,0,1,1,2,2]`
