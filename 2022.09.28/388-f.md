[388. Longest Absolute File Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-absolute-file-path/)

I realized that the number of `\t` indicates the depth of the filesytem, but I wasn't sure what would be a good way to count the max depth and retrieve the path.

The great [Stefan Pochman](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-absolute-file-path/discuss/86619/Simple-Python-solution)'s solution uses a dictionary to keep track of each level's max path.

By splitting the input by `\n`, we can separate the levels of the filepath. So root directory is index 0, any files or directories in root are on their own line and are one `\t` from the root directory.

At each level, we get the file or directory name and its depth (number of `\t`'s). If the current level is a file, we can get it's path length + filename length and compare that to our current max. If the current level is a directory, we add it's length + 1 (for `/`) and set that as the next depth's length.
