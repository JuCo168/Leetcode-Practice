[2401. Longest Nice Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-nice-subarray/)

I should learn the hints from the problem. **Contiguous** hints at using sliding window, and the **AND** of every pair of elements in the subarray hints that all bits must be in distinct positions. Therefore, to determine if a new element `n` is part of a subarray, we can `OR` previous subarray elements and `AND n` to determine if it is part of the subarray.

To shift the sliding window, we `XOR` the first element of the window and increment our left bound.
