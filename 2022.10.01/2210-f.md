[2210. Count Hills and Valleys in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-hills-and-valleys-in-an-array/)

Couldn't think of a super good way to solve other than keep incrementing to find the next hill/vally. Found this [clever solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-hills-and-valleys-in-an-array/discuss/1879182/Two-Pointers) that makes use of two pointers. The faster pointer continues to increment until it finds a hill/valley. It compares to `nums[fast + 1]` and `nums[slow]` which should be at the start of the hill/valley. Only when a hill/valley is found is `slow` updated to `fast`
