[209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

This is a sliding window problem where we want to iterate through the list once. The window will be defined by a `left` and `right` pointer. The `left` pointer starts at `0` and the `right` pointer shifts right until the sum is reached. It then increments the `left` pointer to shrink the window until the sum is no longer reached. Repeat by moving the `right` pointer again.

This works because extending the window will result in a greater sum. So once the sum threshold has been reached, we can try shrinking the window starting with the values on `left` that didn't sum up to our desired sum.
