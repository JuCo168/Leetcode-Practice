[2271. Maximum White Tiles Covered by a Carpet](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-white-tiles-covered-by-a-carpet/)

I remember this being some kind of greedy problem and putting the carpet on the leftmost tile.

[This solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-white-tiles-covered-by-a-carpet/discuss/2038177/PythonGreedy-%2B-prefix-sum-%2B-binary-search-easy-to-understand-with-explanation) uses this idea by maintaining a sorted list of the starting points of each tile segment. For each segment, the carpet is placed and the ending segment closest to the end of the carpet is chosen. To find the next starting segment, `bisect_right` is used.
