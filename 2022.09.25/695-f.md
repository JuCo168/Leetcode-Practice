[695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)

Wow I really had no idea how to start so I looked into the discussion and saw many solutions used DFS. 

The DFS solution works something like this:
- Iterate through each row until a land mass is reached.
- Perform BFS on the land mass by recursively checking cardinal directions while maintaining a counter of the current and max landmass.
- Mark seen land-masses with 0 to avoid repeat calculations.
- Return the max landmass.
