[985. Sum of Even Numbers After Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-even-numbers-after-queries/)

Completely coincidentally this is very similar to [1829. Maximum XOR for Each Query](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-for-each-query/) which I just did yesterday. Again you don't want to add up the array each iteration as that would be `O(n * q)`. Instead you get the even sum after the first query. This is the base. During each query `(i, q)`, there are 4 possibilities: 
- `nums[i]` and `nums[i] + q` are even
    - `nums[i]` is already in our even sum so we simply add `q`
- `nums[i]` is even but `nums[i] + q` is odd
    - We must remove `nums[i]` from our even sum.
- `nums[i]` odd but `nums[i] + q` is even
    - `nums[i]` isn't in our even sum so we must add `nums[i] + q`
- `nums[i]` and `nums[i] + q` are odd
    - The even sum does not change as `nums[i]` is not in the even sum and we can't add `nums[i] + q`
