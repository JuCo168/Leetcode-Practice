[2145. Count the Hidden Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-hidden-sequences/)

There's one observation that let's you solve this in linear time. If we use any value `x` as the first element, we can determine the difference between the `max` and `min` of the list. The logic behind `upper - lower + 1 - (max - min)` is: if our `min = lower`, then `max <= upper`.
The difference between `upper + 1` and `max` is the leeway we have to increase `min` such that `max <= upper`.
