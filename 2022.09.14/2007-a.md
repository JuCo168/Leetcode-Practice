[2007. Find Original Array From Doubled Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-original-array-from-doubled-array/)

Couldn't figure out a fast enough solution until I looked at some others using a map to store frequency then subtracting from the frequency.

I feel like I should be able to solve these relatively easily.
