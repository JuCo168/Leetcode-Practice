[783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/)

Because our tree is a Binary Search Tree, we know that all nodes to the left of the root are less than the root, and all nodes to the right of the root are greater than the root. Therefore the values closes to the root are rightmost node in the left subtree and the leftmost node in the right subtree. This applies recursively and in order traversal lets us compare our previous node and our current node.
