## LeetCode Practice Log

I wanted a way to document my LeetCode practice but I didn't want to do it in a spreadsheet.

Each day gets its own folder and each problem I do that day gets its own folder. I'm aiming for at least 3 problems a day.

File naming
- `problemNumber-status.md`
- `f`: Failed. Didn't manage to solve the problem
- `a`: Needed some assistance (i.e. look at a solution) for a decent amount of the logic
- No status indicates a success
