[1985. Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-kth-largest-integer-in-the-array/)

This is a weird question. Python has a built-in `int()` so you can easily convert all elements to ints and sort them then choose the correct index. This algorithm being `O(nlogn)`.

The interview-approved solution is to write your own comparator to compare the strings. The easiest way to compare strings is to first check length. The longer string will always be the greater number. If the two are the same length, start from the left and compare the characters.

`cmp_to_key` is a neat comparator in Python that lets you write your own comparator and use that to sort.
