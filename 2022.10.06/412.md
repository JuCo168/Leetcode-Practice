[412. Fizz Buzz](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/description/)

The only time I've ever tried Fizz Buzz was in Java after watching an old [Tom Scott video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc). The solutions in the discussion are great, like [Stefan Pochmann's one liner](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/discuss/89928/Python-Golf), or this [Java lambda solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/discuss/89936/Java-Fuzz-Buzz-Follow-up(no-if-else-and-extendable)) or this [C++ multiple loop solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/discuss/149627/C%2B%2B-0ms-Solution-beats-100.00-without-if-else)
