[1975. Maximum Matrix Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matrix-sum/)

The key to this problem is the parity of negative numbers. If the parity is even, then all negative numbers can be changed to positive. If not, we want to minimize the negative number 

We iterate through the matrix to find its max possible sum if all numbers were positive. We also count the number of negatives and keep track of the smallest number.

At the end, if the parity of negatives is even, we can return the max sum. If not, we choose our smallest number to be negative and subtract double from our max sum.
